# Music Player Using SFML

A lightweight command-line music player built in C++ using the SFML library for audio playback. The project includes playlist management, dynamic memory handling, and an undo feature to reverse recent actions. This project showcases the integration of third-party libraries with C++ and efficient data structure usage.

# Features
	•	Audio Playback: Play, pause, and stop songs using the SFML library.
	•	Playlist Management:
	•	Add, remove, and view songs in a playlist.
	•	Navigate through a menu-driven interface.
	•	Undo Functionality: Restore the playlist to its previous state by undoing the last action.
	•	Dynamic Memory Management: Efficiently manage linked lists for playlists.
	•	Command-Line Interface: Simple and intuitive menu-driven interface for user interactions.

# Getting Started

Prerequisites : 
	•	A C++ compiler supporting C++11 or later.
	•	SFML Library:
	•	Install SFML on your system:
	•	Linux: sudo apt-get install libsfml-dev
	•	macOS: brew install sfml
	•	Windows: Download and install from https://www.sfml-dev.org

# Usage
Menu Options:
	1.	Add a song to the playlist.
	2.	Remove a song from the playlist.
	3.	View all songs in the playlist.
	4.	Play a song.
	5.	Undo the last action.
	6.	Exit.

# Commands:
	•	Follow the prompts in the command-line interface to interact with the music player.
	•	Ensure audio files are in the correct format supported by SFML.

# Documentation

Development Background
	•	Objective: Build a lightweight, dynamic music player demonstrating:
	•	Integration of SFML with C++.
	•	Linked list management for playlists.
	•	Command-line user interfaces.

Challenges Addressed:
	1.	Proper integration of SFML with C++ for audio playback.
	2.	Dynamic memory management to handle linked lists effectively.
	3.	Undo feature implementation for playlist management.

Learning Outcomes:
	•	Deepened understanding of data structures.
	•	Enhanced problem-solving skills with third-party libraries.
	•	Experience in managing and optimizing dynamic memory.

# Future Enhancements
	•	Implement a Graphical User Interface (GUI) using SFML.
	•	Add support for shuffle and repeat modes.
	•	Include more detailed audio controls, like seeking and volume adjustment.
	•	Expand to support multiple playlists.
